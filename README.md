APCSP Track: Create Task

## Introduction
Students must collaborate together (groups of 2) to create a program for the AP Computer Science Practicum. In this project, students will develop a program in Python, learn how to submit the program following the College Board requirements, and score each other's APCSP projects using the 2019 Scoring Rubric.

## APCSP Portfolio Task Instructions (Notes)

### Explore - Impact of Computer Innovations
Students must develop a computing innovation (an innovation that includes a program code as an integral part of its functionality) and explore the purpose, function, and effect using a computational artifact (eg. visualization, graphic, video, etc). They must explicitly describe the development process, provide specific details about the data the innovation uses and how it transforms the data, and have reputable references that the student used to create the computational artifact. 

### Create - Applications from Ideas
Students will develop a program on a topic that interests them or solves a problem. The program should use mathematical and logical concepts, implement algorithms, and demonstrates the complexity of the program (eg. APIs).  You will need to submit a video demonstrating a significant feature of the program, a written response PDF file answering specified questions, and the program code.

## APCSP Create - Survival Guide
1. Pick your project (something small enough for you to complete)
2. Timeline
	```
	Hours 1-2: develope a prototype
	Hours 3-7: keep coding
	Hour 8: record your video
	Hours 9-10: write responses to 2b, 2c, 2d questions
	Hours 11-12: preapre to submit the video, response, and code
	```

**What is a good algorithm?**
1. Original (you wrote it, not your partner)
2. Mathematical/Logical Concepts
3. A parent and two children (breakingl larger problems into sub tasks)
4. Talking about your algorithm 

**What is a good abstraction?**
Abstration manages complexity. Programming abstractions make it easier to write complex programs.
1. Original (you wrote it, not your partner)
2. Functions manage complexity (gets called multiple times, parameter)

**Program Check-In Progress**
1. Program purpose
2. Development process overall 
3. Identify main algorithm
4. Your developed abstraction
